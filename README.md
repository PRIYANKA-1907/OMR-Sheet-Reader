# OMR-Sheet-Reader
This project automates the evaluation of large-scale OMR exams, enabling fast, accurate, and scalable processing of answer sheets. It accepts mobile-captured images (JPEG/PNG) and scanned PDFs, corrects orientation and perspective, detects filled bubbles, and computes per-subject and total scores.
